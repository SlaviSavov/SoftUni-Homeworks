# ﻿﻿ Lab: GenericsProblems for exercises and homework for the  [&quot;CSharp Advanced&quot; course @ Software University](https://softuni.bg/courses/csharp-advanced).#**01.Box of T**NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace BoxOfT.Create a class Box<> that can store anything. It should have two public methods:- void Add(element) – adds an element on the top of the list.- element Remove() – removes the topmost element.- int Count { get; }#**02.Generic Array Creator**NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace GenericArrayCreator.Create a class ArrayCreator with a method and a single overload to it:- static T[] Create(int length, T item)The method should return an array with the given length and every element should be set to the given default item.#**03.Generic Scale**NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace GenericScale.Create a class EqualityScale<T> that holds two elements - left and right. The scale should receive the elements through its single constructor:- EqualityScale(T left, T right)The scale should have a single method: - bool AreEqual()The greater of the two elements is the heavier.
